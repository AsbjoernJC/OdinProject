    Applied Accessibility: Improve Accessibility of Audio Content with the audio Element
HTML5's audio element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or audio stream content in your markup. 
Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. 
This can be done with nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript.

The audio tag supports the controls attribute. This shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls, 
and supports keyboard functionality. This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, its presence on the tag turns the setting on.

Here's an example:

<audio id="meowClip" controls>
  <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
  <source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
</audio>
Note: Multimedia content usually has both visual and auditory components. 
It needs synchronized captions and a transcript so users with visual and/or auditory impairments can access it. 
Generally, a web developer is not responsible for creating the captions or transcript, but needs to know to include them.

Time to take a break from Camper Cat and meet fellow camper Zersiax (@zersiax), a champion of accessibility and a screen reader user. 
To hear a clip of his screen reader in action, add an audio element after the p. Include the controls attribute. 
Then place a source tag inside the audio tags with the src attribute set to "https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/screen-reader.mp3" 
and type attribute set to "audio/mpeg".

Note: The audio clip may sound fast an

    Applied Accessibility: Make Screen Reader Navigation Easier with the footer Landmark
Similar to header and nav, the footer element has a built-in landmark feature that allows assistive devices to quickly navigate to it. 
It's primarily used to contain copyright information or links to related documents that usually sit at the bottom of a page.
Camper Cat's training page is making good progress. 
Change the div he used to wrap his copyright information at the bottom of the page to a footer element.

    Applied Accessibility: Wrap Radio Buttons in a fieldset Element for Better Accessibility
The next form topic covers accessibility of radio buttons. 
Each choice is given a label with a for attribute tying to the id of the corresponding item as covered in the last challenge. 
Since radio buttons often come in a group where the user must choose one, there's a way to semantically show the choices are part of a set.

The fieldset tag surrounds the entire grouping of radio buttons to achieve this. 
It often uses a legend tag to provide a description for the grouping, which is read by screen readers for each choice in the fieldset element.

The fieldset wrapper and legend tag are not necessary when the choices are self-explanatory, 
like a gender selection. Using a label with the for attribute for each radio button is sufficient.

Here's an example:

<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Choose one of these three items:</legend>
    <input id="one" type="radio" name="items" value="one">
    <label for="one">Choice One</label><br>
    <input id="two" type="radio" name="items" value="two">
    <label for="two">Choice Two</label><br>
    <input id="three" type="radio" name="items" value="three">
    <label for="three">Choice Three</label>
  </fieldset>
</form>
Camper Cat wants information about the ninja level of his users when they sign up for his email list. 
He's added a set of radio buttons and learned from our last lesson to use label tags with for attributes for each choice. 
Go Camper Cat! However, his code still needs some help. Change the div tag surrounding the radio buttons to a fieldset tag, 
and change the p tag inside it to a legend.
